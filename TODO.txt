TODO:

- Reload fuzzy when tabs are created while popup is open (unlikely to be used)
- Add arrow keys functionality, numbering shortcuts?
- Maybe don't use an input field, rather just type in front of window!
- Number of open tabs displayed on corner?
- Think about multi window support?
- Build simple "make tab active, close popup functionality!"

- Lots of edge cases. Best handled by making extension disappear the moment user clicks away
- Tab snapshot feature sounds cool, a bit tough to implement. Big design challenges there.
- Match highlighting is a killer feature.

TODO's for far from today:

- Logo
- Gifs
- Good presentation
