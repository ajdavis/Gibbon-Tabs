TODO:

- Reload fuzzy when tabs are created while popup is open (unlikely to be used)
- Add arrow keys functionality, numbering shortcuts?
- Maybe don't use an input field, rather just type in front of window!
- Number of open tabs displayed on corner?
- Think about multi window support?
- Build simple "make tab active, close popup functionality!"

TODO's for far from today:

- Logo
- Gifs
- Good presentation
