## Features

- Search and jump to tabs by title or URL, across all your windows.
- Quickly delete tabs while being able to see their title and URL
- Create "Tab Snapshots", a new way to manage your workflow!
- Keyboard shortcuts for navigation and tab deletion will make you very fast

## Tab Snapshots

- Tab Snapshots let you save all your open tabs across all your windows so you can open them later.
- Take a snapshot of...
  - The internal sites you open at work every morning!
  - All the websites you use to procrastinate. Waste lots of time more effectively!
  - The giant hairy ball of tabs you have open which you don't want to close, but you sure as hell don't want to take home at the end of the day. Free your mind!
- Snapshots are stored locally on your device. Not sent to malicious servers!

## Why do I need this?

_If you suffer today from one of the following:_

- Having __dozens of tabs__ open in a one or multiple windows
- Constantly fiddling with keyboard shortcuts to find the tab you need, or worse, using your mouse/trackpad
- That horrible thing that happens where the tab favicons disappear because you have too many open tabs. See below:
