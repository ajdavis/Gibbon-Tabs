# Gibbon-Tabs

A Chrome extension to help you navigate your tab jungle with ease.

## Why do I need this?

_If you suffer today from one of the following:_

- Having dozens of tabs open in a one or multiple windows
- Constantly fiddling with keyboard shortcuts to find the tab you need
- That horrible thing that happens where the tab favicons disappear because you have too many open tabs. See below:
