# Gibbon Tabs

A Chrome extension to help you navigate your tab jungle with ease.

## Features

### Tab Management

- __Search and jump__ to tabs by title or URL, across all your windows.
- __Quickly delete tabs__ while being able to see their title and URL.
- Keyboard shortcuts for navigation and tab deletion will make you very fast.
- It's really pretty to look at!.

### Save Tabs For Later

- __Tab Snapshots let you save all your open tabs across all your windows so you can open them later.__
- Take a snapshot of...
  - The internal sites you open at work every morning!
  - All the websites you use to procrastinate. Waste lots of time more effectively!
  - The giant hairy ball of tabs you have open which you don't want to close, but you sure as hell don't want to take home at the end of the day. Free your mind!
- Snapshots are stored locally on your device. They are not sent anywhere!

## Requirements

- __All you need is Google Chrome!__
  - I am running it on Chrome 56, but it will likely work with older versions as well.

## Installation

- Go to the [Chrome Store page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gibbon-tabs/bmkakdcikgcicahfkmcehpbhidhccfld) and install the extension.
- __It is highly recommended that you assign a keyboard shortcut to the Gibbon Tabs extension.__
  - In order to do this open [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) (type this URL in a new tab)
  - Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on "Keyboard Shortcuts" (see image below).

  </p>

  - Refresh the chrome://extension page and the shortcut will become active!

## Usage

- Press the shortcut you assigned or click on the extension icon in your browser to activate it.
- __Type to begin searching__. The search box is always highlighted.
- Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to activate a tab. Or click on it.
- Use the <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> keys to navigate the tabs list.
- Press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Backspace</kbd> to delete the currently highlighted tab in the tabs list.
  - You can also delete tabs by clicking on the X at the right side of each tab in the list.
- There are no shortcuts for "Tab Snapshots". Just use it once and you'll learn how it works!

## Why do I need this?

_If you suffer today from one of the following:_

- Having __dozens of tabs__ open in one or multiple windows.
- Constantly fiddling with keyboard shortcuts to find the tab you need, or worse, using your mouse/trackpad.
- That horrible thing that happens where the tab favicons disappear because you have too many open tabs. See below:

  <em>Welcome to Tab Hell. You can go throw yourself in the lava pit now.</em>
</p>

- Heartache and wrist pain.

_Then Gibbon Tabs is for You!_
